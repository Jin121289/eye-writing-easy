# simple eye-writing project

This is a short & simple project of eye tracking and writing.
It makes use of machine learning-based facial mapping (landmarks) with dlib + python + openCV, with eyes projection on a virtual keyboard. 
The algorithm works in real-time on the video-stream from the webcam. 

Feel free to use the code, play around with it, improve it, enjoy, learn, and think new ideas!

Logic flow:

- find face and track the right eye;
- calibrate the proper range of allowed space for (comfortable) movement;

(then, frame by frame)

- track the right eye and project its centroid on a virtual keyboard in a "working window";
- take inputs and, specifically, "press" the key, using blinking detection;
- updtate a text string and print on screen (and, by just adding a couple of line, on a file).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
The python script is highly simplified for didactic purposes (high-school / BSc level), with a basic structure (only main and functions).
All the necessary functions are in the single file eye_key_funcs.py. The virtual keyboard is in projected_keyboard.py.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements: 
- python2 (python3 works too)
- opencv
- numpy
- dlib (and the trained model shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat; see below)
